  bio         : "I am a digital ethnographer studying human experiences on social platforms. I am currently working on memorialization and postmortem interactions. My past work looked at real name policies and kindness on discussion boards about charity campaigns. I earned an MA in Communication, Culture, and Technology at Georgetown University in 2015, and a BA in Cultural Anthropology at Kansas State University in 2009. I like memes, mountains, and making ice cream."
