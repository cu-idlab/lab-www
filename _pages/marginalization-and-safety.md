Connected digital technologies, like social media platforms and mobile applications, offer many benefits to users of marginalized identities. They provide avenues for identity exploration, access to otherwise inaccessible resources, and opportunities for building community. However, they can also put users at risk for negative, harmful, and damaging encounters. Harassment by other users, incidental interactions with violent content, and even outing by the system itself all present potential dangers to using these types of technologies--dangers that can even harmfully impact people's offline lives. These unsafe situations are often more precarious for users of (multiply) marginalized identities, such as LGBTQ users, people of color, and women. We are working towards developing better understandings of safety and harm in digital spaces, as well as researching these experiences to better understand how to mitigate their affects.
