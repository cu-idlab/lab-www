Our research group is currently speaking with people about their interpretation of the use of dead data in the future. This research is being conducted by Jed Brubaker at the University of Colorado Boulder. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to better understand the impact of how post mortem data will be implemented and influence future technologies.

There are two phases of this project. We are currently in Phase 1, which is conducting prototype-based interviews with particiapnts. These interviews will last approximently 30 to 90 minutes. Phase two of the project will consist of analyzing our interview data to draw meaningful conclusions of how post mortem data can be used currently, and in the future. Further, we will be able to draw insightful conclusions about how people respond to companies using this data.

This project is currently being led by Chris Koehler, Kyle Frye, Jacob Paul and Tom Slesinger who are Undergrads in the Identity Lab. Their advisor is Dr. Jed Brubaker, who is leading the frontier of post-mortem interactions. More information about Dr. Brubaker can be on the [About](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/about/) page.
