It's rare for someone to only have an account on one social media website; people create accounts across all sorts of social media sites, ranging from the more commonly used, like Facebook or Twitter, to more niche sites that cater to specific interests. What's more, people often create multiple accounts within a single site, even when the site itself explicitly prohibits this type of behavior. Across all of these sites and accounts, people create identities that their audiences subsequently see, interpret, and react to.

Sometimes, these constructed identities align perfectly across an individual's online presence. However, it is more common that each account on each site is tailored with a specific audience in mind. Where a Facebook profile might contain more tightly curated posts and pictures to account for the wider audience that can see those posts, a F(riend)Instagram might contain posts that are less curated, because the audience that can see those posts is much more controlled.

In this project, we investigate the concept of identity ecologies -- how people create identity in different online spaces and for (and maybe in reaction to) different audiences. In doing so, we tackle several overarching questions-How do identities and audiences cross between different platform boundaries? How do people navigate these complex networks during identity shifts? What causes them to engage or disengage from a platform, effectively creating a new identity or deleting a previous one from their identity ecology?

<!--Effective regulation is one of the most important factors that make online communities successful. While communities are certainly governed by platform policies such as user agreements and content policies, the majority of the moderation work is accomplished by volunteer moderators who enforce rules created by their own communities. In this project, we deeply investigate the moderation ecosystem of online communitiesâ€”What are the existing rules? How are these rules created and enforced? How do the moderation teams work behind the scene? And how does the moderation ecosystem expand across multiple communities and platforms?

Our prior work includes a mixed-methods study of 100,000 subreddits and their rules. Our findings characterize the types of rules across Reddit, the frequency of rules at scale, and patterns of rules based on subreddit characteristics. We find that rules appear to be context-dependent for individual subreddits but also share common characteristics across the site. Taken together, our findings provide a rich description of this ecosystem of rules, motivating further inquiry into underlying mechanisms for rule formation and enforcement in online communities.

<!--We are studying the experiences of trans and non-binary social media users to understand their experiences with coming out across their various social media presences. We are particularly focusing on the effect of audience and platform, and how these factors affect the decision around and experience of coming out across various social media sites.

<!-- There are initially two phases in this project. We are currently in Phase 1, conducting exploratory interviews with participants. -->

<!-- #### Phase 1: Exploratory Interviews

In this phase, we seek to understand what social media platforms are being used by trans users, how they are using them, and how they feel system design and their audiences affect they way they use them. This includes exploring how identity is constructed and changes over time in different social medias, as well how online interactions can lead to positive or negative outcomes.

#### Phase 2: Trace Ethnography and Network Analysis

Following Phase 1, we anticipate conducting a trace ethnography and network analysis using donated data from participants' social media. In this approach, we will observe what users post on social media, how they utilize system features to control the audience to these posts, and how this controlled audience responds. This phase will examine how these behaviors vary across the various social media sites that participants use.

#### Research Team

This project is led by Anthony Pinter, a PhD student in the Identity Lab. Anthony's pronouns are he/his. More information about Anthony can be found on the [About](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/about/) page. Anthony's advisor, Dr. Jed Brubaker, is also involved in the project, and has experience in this research area (see [Haimson, Brubaker, Dombrowski, & Hayes, 2015](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/assets/bibliography/pdf/p1176-haimson.pdf) and [Haimson, Brubaker, Dombrowski, & Hayes, 2016](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/assets/bibliography/pdf/p2895-haimson.pdf)).

Currently supporting Anthony in this project are two undergraduate research assistants:
- Kayden Adams is an undergraduate student at CU Boulder, majoring in Computer Science. Kayden's pronouns are they/them.
- Rachael Robinson is an undergraduate student at CU Boulder, majoring in Applied Mathematics. Rachael's pronouns are she/her. -->

This project is supported by the CU Beverly Sears Small Grant and the CU UROP programs.
