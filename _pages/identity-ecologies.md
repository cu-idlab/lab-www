UNDER CONSTRUCTION :)

<!--We are studying the experiences of trans and non-binary social media users to understand their experiences with coming out across their various social media presences. We are particularly focusing on the effect of audience and platform, and how these factors affect the decision around and experience of coming out across various social media sites.

<!-- There are initially two phases in this project. We are currently in Phase 1, conducting exploratory interviews with participants. -->

<!-- #### Phase 1: Exploratory Interviews

In this phase, we seek to understand what social media platforms are being used by trans users, how they are using them, and how they feel system design and their audiences affect they way they use them. This includes exploring how identity is constructed and changes over time in different social medias, as well how online interactions can lead to positive or negative outcomes.

#### Phase 2: Trace Ethnography and Network Analysis

Following Phase 1, we anticipate conducting a trace ethnography and network analysis using donated data from participants' social media. In this approach, we will observe what users post on social media, how they utilize system features to control the audience to these posts, and how this controlled audience responds. This phase will examine how these behaviors vary across the various social media sites that participants use.

#### Research Team

This project is led by Anthony Pinter, a PhD student in the Identity Lab. Anthony's pronouns are he/his. More information about Anthony can be found on the [About](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/about/) page. Anthony's advisor, Dr. Jed Brubaker, is also involved in the project, and has experience in this research area (see [Haimson, Brubaker, Dombrowski, & Hayes, 2015](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/assets/bibliography/pdf/p1176-haimson.pdf) and [Haimson, Brubaker, Dombrowski, & Hayes, 2016](http://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/assets/bibliography/pdf/p2895-haimson.pdf)).

Currently supporting Anthony in this project are two undergraduate research assistants:
- Kayden Adams is an undergraduate student at CU Boulder, majoring in Computer Science. Kayden's pronouns are they/them.
- Rachael Robinson is an undergraduate student at CU Boulder, majoring in Applied Mathematics. Rachael's pronouns are she/her. -->

This project is supported by the CU Beverly Sears Small Grant and the CU UROP programs.
